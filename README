this is a bot that automatically mirrors links posted in one channel to another "feed" channel

features:

- emoji reactions to manually mirror messages from arbitrary channels
- emoji reactions to manually remove messages from feed
- can automatically add emoji reactions to feed messages, for informational use by others
- updates feed messages when original message is edited or deleted

how to use:

- write a configuration file (see conf.example.json for structure)
- run `logiclink.py your/conf/file.json', or just `logiclink.py' which defaults to conf.json in the current directory

configuration:

- src:       source channels, messages posted here with links will automatically get mirrored
- src_extra: extra source channels, messages posted here with reactions above threshold will get mirrored
- dst:       destination channel, where to mirror to
- admin:     user id of the user who is allowed to run !eval (for debugging)
- token:     discord bot token
- table:     path to file to store persistent data in
- threshold: number of non-original-poster reactions necessary to trigger bot actions
